-Create an llvm plugin/module/pass? that will do two things.
        1) After code has been parsed, for all user-defined functions,
           a wrapper function will be made that takes in the same arguments
           as the original user-defined functions. This function will have
           some code that does the following:
                A) Fetches the address,len(in bytes), and key
                   of the original function.
                B) Runs through a function.
                   This function is taken from a .c file that is read in and used
                   as the main packer. This function is used to
                   to decrypt the address space of the original function.
                C) Uses original function's passed arguments
                   and jumps to original function's address
        2) During Code generation for whichever architecture, 
           a list of function addresses which have been marked "encrypt"?
           will be encrypted using its appropriate key and len of function.
           This lookup table should be the same as the one used by 1A.
            

-some ideas about taking in a user-defined packer function and make it a llvm
function. have some c code that packs the binary, compile with
